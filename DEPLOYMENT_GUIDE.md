# Deployment Guide for MyNotebook

## Backend Deployment on Render

### Environment Variables Required:
1. **mongoURI** - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - Value: `mongodb+srv://subhosreebanerjeedms154:Mynotebook@cluster0.jyx2lgy.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Push your backend code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
3. Set the environment variable `mongoURI` in Render dashboard with the above value
4. Deploy the service

## Frontend Deployment on Netlify

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Run `npm run build` in your frontend directory
2. Upload the `build` folder to Netlify
3. Your frontend is now connected to the deployed backend

## Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Backend port configuration (now uses `process.env.PORT`)
2. ✅ CORS configuration (allows both localhost and production domains)
3. ✅ MongoDB connection (uses MongoDB Atlas for both local and production)

4. ✅ Frontend API calls (environment-based URL configuration)
5. ✅ Error handling (improved error messages and debugging)
6. ✅ Local development setup (automatically uses local backend when running locally)
7. ✅ Import path fixes (corrected API configuration import paths)
8. ✅ Environment variables (added dotenv support for local development)

## Key Changes Made:
- **Environment-based API URLs**: Frontend now automatically uses local backend (`http://localhost:5000`) for development and deployed backend (`https://backend-mynotebook-xnja.onrender.com`) for production
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and better error messages for debugging
- **Better CORS Configuration**: Supports both development and production environments
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration**: Both local and production now use the same MongoDB Atlas database
- **Centralized API Configuration**: All API calls use a single configuration file for consistency

## Testing:
### Local Development:
1. Run `npm run both` in your project directory
2. The frontend will automatically connect to your local backend
3. Test all functionality locally

### Production:
1. Visit your Netlify URL: https://mynotebook2005new.netlify.app
2. Try to sign up for a new account
3. Try to login with existing credentials
4. Create, edit, and delete notes

Your application should now work perfectly in both local development and production environments!
